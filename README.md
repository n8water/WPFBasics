# WPFBasics
wpf Tutorial Output

This is my work along project for the Youtube Playlist "WPF UI Programming (C#)" by AngelSix

I guess each Video will get a own Window, or project in this solution. Depends on his approach in the future lessons.

I might add some own teststuff, because I plan to use WPF for my final course project.
